	<div class="loadThis aboutme" id="scrollbar">
		<p>It seems that coding has always been part of my life. I learned my first languages by looking at the code, playing with it for hours just to see what it does. It was years later when I made a conscious decision to go for it, that I first started following actual tutorials.</p>
		<p>What I enjoy the most about coding, is getting lost in it all. I can spend hours in front of computer, hacking, w/o ever feeling like I'm working. It's just so relaxing. It's much easier than writing about my self, I can tell you that much.</p>
		<p>My plans for future, include getting into blockchain development. This area seems so fascinating to me. Having permanent, imutable data storage that is spread across multiple hosts rather than being controlled by a single party, seems like the way to go. </p>
